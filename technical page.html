        <p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

        <p>Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. </p>
        <p>Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its source code was released as open-source software. </p>
        <p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[Wikipedia]</p>

            <li>Bitcoin does not have a central authority.</li>
            <li>There is no central server</li>
            <li>The bitcoin network is peer-to-peer.</li>
            <li>There is no central storage</li>
            <li>The bitcoin ledger is distributed.</li>
            <li>The ledger is public; anybody can store it on their computer.</li>
            <li>There is no single administrator;[8] the ledger is maintained by a network of equally privileged miners.</li>
            <li>Anybody can become a miner.</li>
            <li>The additions to the ledger are maintained through competition. Until a new block is added to the ledger, it is not known which miner will create the block.</li>
            <li>The issuance of bitcoins is decentralized. They are issued as a reward for the creation of a new block.
                Anybody can create a new bitcoin address (a bitcoin counterpart of a bank account) without needing any approval.</li>
            <li>Anybody can send a transaction to the network without needing any approval; the network merely confirms that the transaction is legitimate.</li>

            With banks constantly in and out of crises(2008, 2011) and with the current situation of negative interest rates. </p>
        <p> It paints a scary picture for our current financial system. And rightly so, people are looking for new alternatives and currencies. </p>

        <p> Many have argued that Bitcoin is a passing phase in our financial system, and more of a nerdy hype.</p>
        <p> However, the data as well as bitcoin's constant presence in our system over the last 5 years shows that its not going anywhere.</p>
        <code> With the recent backing from China as well as the emergence of Bakkt give major credibility to Bitcoin.</code>
        <p> Which grants, as we all know, the only necessary characteristic for any currency.</p> <p> That people believe in it, since currency is only an idea and not actually real</p>
        <p><code>All money is a matter of belief</code></p>
        <p>
            <code>If all the economists were laid end to end, they'd never reach a conclusion.</code></p>
        <p><code> "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts." -Satoshi Nakamoto</code></p>
